# quagroom2

Quagroom2 is a redesign I was working on for my website quagroom.com. I wrote all code using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the jQuery library.

The design is unfinished and I am no longer working on it. To view it properly, resize the browser window so that the height is greater than the width.
