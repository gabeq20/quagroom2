# quagroom2

Quagroom2 is a redesign I was working on for a website I created in 2022, quagroom.com. Its purpose was to share music I made.

I wrote all code for quagroom2 using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the jQuery library.

The design is unfinished and I am no longer working on it. To view it properly, resize the browser window so that the height is greater than the width.
